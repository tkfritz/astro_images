    "There is one now at not extactly the same position as the local maximum in the F1 score. For linear there is also a minimum now visible, a clearly worse, but still better than a constant probability, similar as to xgboost the local shifts compared to the local maximum in the F1 score.  That shifting is bot ideal, I should likely add rotations mirrorring versions for fitting in any case but is unlikely to solve the main torch problem since it only incrtease the data amount by a factor 8 even if there is no more fundamental problem in torch, which is not clear.
