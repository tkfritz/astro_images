    "For all example I looked on until now the type is obvious to the expect eye. Paretly that are elliptical galaxies where the reason is less obvious to my eye but a likely reason is that will linear algorithm can get the overall shape profile, when object are well centered (as it is here the case) they have more problems with small details which make the spiral definition. In case of missclassified spiral it is visible, that nearly all are edge on spirals. That is not surprising, when they are minority of the sample, since they are clearly different from face on spirals. \n",
