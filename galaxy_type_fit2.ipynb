    "For logistic, the minimum in test gets just broader, but for xgboost there is a clear improvement, which is at possible slightly smaller regularizationas as expected since the sample is larger now. \n",
    "Also for the convolutional network the performance improves clearly and also somewhat for perceptron. For both the minimum seems at smaller regularization and is not necessary fully explored yet.  Since the number of iteration is no necessary best a further improvment might be possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that logistic does not improve likely means that the feature distingushing the classes are either nonlinear or that at least one class consist of different subclasses which cannot be combined in effect. The latter is very likely to be the case since spiral seen under different angles look very different. "
